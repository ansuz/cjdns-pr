Since I made this repo, a large part of the Hyperborian community has begun working on [an excellent collection of cjdns/Hyperborian/projectmeshnet documentation](https://github.com/ProjectMeshnet/documentation).

You are strongly urged to read and develop that collection instead of this one. That being said, I'm still going to leave this one here.

what you need to know about cjdns

This technology is so radically different from conventional networking software that it's hard to even choose a place to start when someone asks about it.

To that end, I'm going to try to provide a set of concise explanations that you can use when trying to convince people why **cjdns** is such a good idea.

The idea is to provide some plain markdown files that people can style however they want. I'm planning to include some scripts to convert them to HTML, or PPT slides.

This is very much a work in progress, and your input is quite welcome. Jump on the wiki, or fork and file a pull request to get involved.

Start by looking in "docs".
